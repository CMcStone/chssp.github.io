  <h3>Circle I: European Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    The European circle was the poorest and least developed circle in the 13th century, because there
    were not many products from Europe that the Muslims, Indians or Chinese wanted to buy. The Europeans,
    on the other hand, were hungry for luxury products from Asia. The first important trade link was
    established between Venice and Genoa in northern Italy and Brugesin Flanders. The merchants traveled
    overland and met halfway at fairs in Champagne during the 13th century. There they exchanged the fine
    wool cloth made in Flanders for the imported goods from Asia. In the 14th century, the Genoese
    and Catalans figured out how to navigate through the difficult wind pattern at the Strait of
    Gibraltar (the exit of the Mediterranean Sea into the Atlantic Ocean) and then began sailing from
    Genoa to Bruges. From the trade city at Bruges, merchants spread the imported products all over
    northern Europe.</p>
  <p><strong>Main trade cities:</strong>
    Bruges, Venice, Genoa</p>

  <h3>Circle II: Mediterranean Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    Ships from the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa picked up the products of Asia (spices, silk,
    jewels) from Muslim and Jewish merchants at ports on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea or
    on the Black Sea. The Venetians and Genoese sold wool cloth, slaves, furs and silver made or
    collected in Europe to Muslim or Jewish merchants. The Venetians and Genoese then sold the Asian
    products to wealthy people in Europe. During the Crusades, Latin Christian crusaders conquered
    Mediterranean ports which were at the end of the Silk Road trade routes, such as Acre and Tyre. The
    crusaders gave the Venetians and Genoese, their fellow Latin Christians, trading rights at those
    ports. After 1291, when Baybars of the Mamluk Sultanate (Egypt) defeated the last of the crusaders,
    the Venetians moved their businesses to trade at Alexandria and Cairo, and the Genoese moved their
    businesses to Caffa (on the north shore of the Black Sea.) All of these ports were at the end of
    land trade routes from the east. North African Muslim merchants also sold gold (from Mali) at Cairo
    and other North African ports.</p>

<div id="overland-circuit"> <a name="overlandcircuit" id="overlandcircuit"></a>
  <h3>Circle III: Overland Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    This route, part of which is the Silk Road, had been traveled for more than a thousand years before
    the medieval period. The land of Central Asia is mostly desert, steppe or mountains, and few people
    lived along the route. Finding water was a major problem, and bandits often robbed caravans. For
    these reasons, the land route was more dangerous and expensive than the sea routes between the
    Mediterranean and Indian Oceans and had become much less popular than Circles IV (the Persian Gulf
    circle) and V (the Red Sea circle.) When the Mongols conquered their huge empire, the new Mongol
    rulers got rid of dangerous bandits, protected caravans, and established peace. Merchants had to pay
    the Mongols tribute (like a tax), but this tribute was less than others charged. The Mongols also
    maintained a road network, with caravanserais (businesses which provided shelter, food and water for
    caravan merchants and their animals) at each stopping point. Mongol rule made the overland route to
    the east more cost-effective. Marco Polo and his relatives traveled this route on their journey to
    China, and John of Montecorvino, an Italian Franciscan missionary, wrote that it took less than one
    year to travel between the Mediterranean and China by this route. When the Mongol empire broke up in
    the 14th century, bandits again threatened merchants on the overland route, and merchants switched
    back to the safer sea routes.</p>

<!-- Persian Gulf Circuit -->
<div id="persian-gulf-circuit"> <a name="persiangulfcircuit" id="persiangulfcircuit"></a>
  <h3>Circle IV: Persian Gulf Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    This circle was one of three trade routes that connected the Mediterranean Sea area with the Indian
    Ocean and east Asia. The trade route began at the Syrian ports on the eastern coast (also called the
    Levant) of the Mediterranean Sea. Before 1280, these ports were controlled by Venice, because they
    were located in the Crusader kingdoms. Even though they were sometimes at war with each other,
    Muslim and Christian states signed treaties to protect each other’s merchants and their goods.
    Traveling inland from the port, merchants crossed the desert to the Tigris River and then took ship
    down the river to Baghdad. From there, merchants traveled down the river to the Persian Gulf, and
    across the Arabian Sea to India to northwest India (Gujarat), the Malabar coast and/or Ceylon. John
    of Montecorvino, an Italian Franciscan missionary, wrote that it took 2 years to travel from the
    Mediterranean to China by this route. After the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258 and the Egyptian
    Mamluks took over the Crusader kingdoms in 1291, this route became less safe and less popular than
    the Red Sea Circuit. The Mamluks no longer allowed Christian merchants to travel across Muslim lands.</p>
  <p><strong>Main trade cities:</strong>
    Tyre, Acre, Baghdad, Oman</p>
  <p><strong>Products Imported:</strong>
    [Many products from China and East Asia were transported through this circle to be sold in other
    circles.] silk, paper (from China), spices, jewels (from India and Southeast Asia), silver, slaves
    (from Europe and Mongol lands), drugs, perfumes, saffron, teakwood, ivory, pearls, onyx, rubies,
    ebony, sugar, aloes, iron, lead, canes, earthenware, sandalwood, glass, and pepper (according to
    Muhammad al-Muqaddasi, a geographer born in Jerusalem in 945).</p>
  <p><strong>Products exported:</strong>
    cotton, sugar, carpets, silk, linen, brocade (cloth of gold), steel, swords, pearls, dates, henna</p>
  <p><strong>Major shippers:</strong>
    Arab, Persian, and Indian shippers; Muslim and Jewish merchants from Egypt, Syria, and Persia. The
    sources usually call these shippers and merchants “Arabs,” but they probably came from many
    different lands, such as Persia, India, Southeast Asia, and east Africa.</p>
  <p><strong>Method of travel:</strong>
    Over land, merchants traveled together in caravans of camels, horses and mules.  On the seas and
    rivers, shippers used dhows (small trading ships with lateen sails)</p>
  <p><strong>Important States:</strong>
    Mongol Il-Khanate, Crusader Kingdoms, Mamluk Egypt, Turkish sultanates, Persia</p>
  <p><strong>People:</strong>
    Arabs, Syrians, Persians, Turks, Indians, Venetians, Genoese</p>

<!-- Red Sea Circuit -->
<div id="red-sea-circuit"> <a name="redseacircuit" id="redseacircuit"></a>
  <h3>Circle V: Red Sea Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This circuit was one of the three middle routes between the Mediterranean and East Asia.  After the fall of
    Baghdad in 1258 and the Crusader kingdoms in 1291, Mamluk Egypt became the most powerful state in the western Muslim world.
    The Mamluks were a dynasty of slave-soldiers.  Non-Muslims from Central Asia were sold into slavery as young boys, carried to
    Cairo on Genoese ships, and trained as soldiers by older Mamluk slave-soldiers.  Talented Mamluk slaves could rise to become
    officials in the Mamluk government.  When the old sultan died, an experienced and powerful slave-general became the new sultan.
    Merchants came from the Egyptian population and were both Muslim and Jewish.  The greatest Muslim Mamluk traders, known as the
    Karimi merchants, monopolized the trade of Asian products into the Mediterranean and Europe.  Travel decreased along the other
    two middle routes (circuits III and IV), and Venetian and Genoese merchants came to Cairo to get products from the east in
    exchange for slaves from Europe and the Mongol steppe.  To protect their monopoly  on trade, the Mamluks did not allow Venetian,
    Genoese, or any other Christian merchants to sail south and east of Cairo.</p>
  <p><strong>Main trade cities:</strong>
    Cairo, Alexandria, Aden</p>
  <p><strong>Products imported:</strong>
    [Many products from China and East Asia were transported through this circuit to be sold in other
    circuits.] slaves (from Europe and Central Asia), paper, ebony, coconuts (from China and India),
    metals (from Europe), spices (from southeast Asia), black pepper, cotton cloth, jewels (from India),
    porcelain and silk (from China)</p>
  <p><strong>Products exported:</strong>
    papyrus paper, carpets, cotton and linen cloth, glassware, hawks, and sugar. In Cairo there were
    many workshops that manufactured goods such as swords and armor, leather objects, furniture, paper
    and cloth.</p>
  <p><strong>Major Shippers:</strong>
    Venetian, Genoese, Arab, Persian and Indian shippers; Karimi merchants (private Egyptian Muslim
    merchants), Jewish, Muslim and Christian merchants from Venice, Genoa, Egypt, Syria, Persia </p>
  <p><strong>Method of Travel:</strong>
    Boats could sail from the Arabian Sea into the Red Sea and then take a canal over to the Nile River
    at Cairo. They could then sail up the Nile to the Mediterranean Sea. Italian ships sailed to
    Alexandria in convoys (large groups of ships sailing together.)</p>

<div id="arabian-sea-circuit"> <a name="arabianseacircuit" id="arabianseacircuit"></a>
  <h3>Circle VI: Arabian Sea Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    This circle is one of the oldest trade routes in world history. Ships have been crossing it for the
    last 4,000 years. This Arabian Sea circle depended on the monsoon winds. The only other way to sail
    from India to Arabia was to sail along the coast, which took much more time. Because ships had to
    delay six months to a year to wait for the right monsoon winds, merchants and shippers set up homes
    and communities in Indian ports, such as Cambay (in Gujarat), Quilon or Calicut (on the Malabar
    coast). They intermarried with local Indians and depended on family members and people who had come
    from their own home towns to do business. The sources identify these people as Muslims, even though
    they probably came from different ethnic groups and religions (some were Jewish or Hindu). Although
    north-central India was united in the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526), the rest of India was divided
    into small kingdoms and city-states with local rulers. In this circle there was no one dominant
    state controlling trade. Inside there were lots of smaller states and a common culture that valued
    trade connections and business. All shippers and merchants respected the right of other ships to
    travel and trade in the circle, except there were many pirates who attacked ships.</p>
  <p><strong>Main trade cities:</strong>
    Aden, Hormuz, Cambay, Quilon, Calicut</p>
  <p><strong>Products imported:</strong>
    Silk, porcelain and manufactured luxury goods (from China), glassware (from the Mediterranean),
    spices, perfumes (from Southeast Asia) metals, armor, weapons, perfumes (from Egypt, Arabia and
    Persia), and slaves (from East Africa and the Mongol steppe). Unlike some other circles, here ships
    carried many more ordinary bulk items, such as metal utensils, weapons, grain, sugar, butter, salt,
    dried food, horses and lumber, from one place to another within this circle. This means that there
    was much more dependence on trade networks in this circle.</p>
  <p><strong>Products exported:</strong>
    Cotton cloth, pepper, jewels (from India), silk and cotton cloth (from Egypt and Persia)</p>
  <p><strong>Major shippers:</strong>
    Arab, Persian, Indian and Southeast Asian shippers; Karimi merchants (from Mamluk Egypt), Jewish,
    Arab, Persian, Indian and Chinese merchants. The sources identify the shippers and merchants as
    “Arabs” or “Muslims”, but some were probably East African, Persian, Javan,
    Chinese, or Filipino.</p>
  <p><strong>Method of travel:</strong>
    The two types of ships used in this circle were junks and dhows. Ships sailed in convoys, following
    the monsoon sailing seasons. A ship could sail from west to east across this circle from February to
    May and from mid-August to the end of September. A ship could also sail down the east coast of
    Africa (the Swahili Coast) to Kilwa and other ports during this monsoon season. A ship could sail
    from east to west (and north from Africa) from mid-October to mid-April. See the monsoon maps and
    tables for more information.</p>

<div id="india-southeast-asia-circuit"> <a name="india-southeastasiacircuit" id="india-southeastasiacircuit"></a>
  <h3>Circle VII: India-Southeast Asia Circuit</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    Trade in this circle depended on the monsoon winds. In addition, ships had to sail through the
    narrow Strait of Malacca to go from the Bay of Bengal into the South China Sea. Because ships had to
    delay six months to a year to wait for the right monsoon winds, merchants and shippers set up homes
    and communities in ports on the Coromandel coast (southeast India), the Malay peninsula, and the
    Southeast Asian islands. Merchants from China, Southeast Asia, India, Persia and Arabia intermarried
    with local people and depended on family members and people who had come from their own home towns
    to do business. These merchants carried their religions, beliefs and customs with them and gradually
    spread those to the local communities. The biggest cultural influence from 1000 through 1300 was the
    Hindu religion and south Indian culture, but Buddhism, Chinese culture, and later the Muslim
    religion were also influential. All of the land regions of this circle were divided into small
    states or smaller village communities. Those towns and states that were on the coast depended on sea
    trade for local trade and luxuries. Their rulers looked to India and China as powerful cultures that
    could give them power and prestige. Chinese naval fleets, under Zheng He and other commanders, often
    sailed throughout this circle. Shippers and merchants respected the right of other ships to travel
    and trade in the circle, except there were pirates, especially in the Strait of Malacca.</p>
  <p><strong>Main trade cities:</strong>
    Palembang (Srivijaya), Malacca (after 1430), Quilon, Calicut</p>
  <p><strong>Products imported:</strong>
    Silk, porcelain and manufactured goods (from China), silk and cotton cloth (from Egypt and Persia),
    horses and glassware (from the Mediterranean), metals, armor, weapons, perfumes (from Egypt, Arabia
    and Persia), and slaves (from East Africa and the Mongol steppe)</p>
  <p><strong>Products exported:</strong>
    Cotton cloth (from India), spices, black pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardemom, cloves, nutmeg, pearls,
    coral, betelnuts, aromatics (camphor, sandalwood), dyes, medicines, tropical wood, resin (from
    Sumatra)</p>
  <p><strong>Major Shippers:</strong>
    Arab, Persian, , Indian, Malay, Sumatran, Tamil (from the Chola kingdom and Coromandel), Javan and
    Chinese shippers and merchants. The sources identify the merchants as “Arabs”,
    “Muslims” or Chinese, but some were probably East African, Persian, Vietnamese, Javan,
    Malaysian, or Filipino.</p>
  <p><strong>Method of Travel:</strong>
    The two types of ships used in this circle were junks and dhows. Ships sailed in convoys, following
    the monsoon sailing seasons. A ship could sail from west to east across this circle from February
    to May and from mid-August to the end of September. It could also sail south to the islands. A ship
    could sail from east to west (and north from the islands) from mid-October to mid-April. The wind
    patterns changed at the Strait of Malacca, and ships had to time their arrival there between
    December and mid-February if they were going from China to India. Sailing around the southern tip of
    India and Ceylon was very difficult. See the monsoon maps and tables for more information.</p>

  <h3>Circle VIII: China-Southeast Asia Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    The empire of China was the most powerful state in the medieval world, and it dominated this
    circuit. Chinese naval fleets dominated the smaller kingdoms of Southeast Asia and took tribute from
    them for the Chinese emperor. The Chinese usually did not want to conquer lands, but they wanted the
    leaders of Southeast Asian states, such as Champa and Srivijaya, to acknowledge Chinese superiority
    and authority. Early Ming emperors sent out large naval fleets to extend Chinese power. From 1405 to
    1433, Admiral Zheng He commanded seven huge fleets which explored the near Pacific islands,
    Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean, collected tribute and rare items, and spread Chinese
    authority. Because of threats on the northern border and the great cost of the voyages, a new
    emperor and his administration ended the voyages in 1433 and abandoned the Chinese fleet. Private
    Chinese merchants continued to sail and trade. The Chinese government allowed foreign merchants to
    trade in Chinese ports, especially Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Quanzhou. Main trade cities: Guangzhou,
    Hangzhou, Quanzhou, Palembang, Malacca (after 1430</p>
  <p><strong>Products imported:</strong>
    black pepper, cotton textiles, pearls, horses (from India), ambergris, frankincense and glassware
    (from Arabia, the Mediterranean, or east Africa), spices, sandalwood and tortoiseshells (from
    Southeast Asia to China), silk, porcelain, iron products (from China to Southeast Asia)</p>
  <p><strong>Products exported:</strong>
    porcelain, silk, manufactured luxury goods, tea, cotton, sugar, cannons, coins, paper (from China),
    spices, aromatics, tropical woods (from Southeast Asia), rice, swords, timber, medicines (from the
    Philippines)</p>
  <p><strong>Major shippers:</strong>
    Arab, Persian, Indian, Southeast Asian and Chinese shippers; merchants from China, Arabia, Persia,
    and India; Muslim, Jewish and a few Christian (Italian) merchants</p>
  <p><strong>Method of travel:</strong>
    Most travel in this circuit was by sea using junks, first made in China, but later also made in
    Southeast Asian ports. Ships followed the monsoon sailing seasons to travel between China and the
    southern islands. From the seaports, merchants carried the trade goods inland throughout China.
    These merchants traveled by boat on rivers and canals, and by packtrain over land.</p>
  <p><strong>Important States:</strong>

  <h3>Circle IX: Trans-Saharan Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description: </strong>
    This circle connected the north coast of Africa (the Maghrib towns in the west and Cairo in the
    east) with the gold region of West Africa. The merchants (who came from North Africa) had to cross
    the Sahara Desert by going from oasis to oasis. The merchants carried salt from the northern Sahara
    to southern gold region, which did not have enough salt for the people who lived there. Merchants
    probably also carried cotton cloth, luxury silks, spices, and manufactured goods from Mamluk Egypt
    and Asia. In addition to gold, those merchants bought ivory and slaves from African merchants. The
    Muslim religion spread along with the merchants.  Many people in West Africa converted to Islam. The
    biggest kingdom in West Africa from the 12th to the 15th centuries was Mali. Genoese and Catalan
    merchants traveled to north African ports to buy gold, but the Muslim merchants of the Maghrib would
    not let them travel south across the Sahara. This was one reason why the Portuguese began sailing
    into the eastern Atlantic and down the coast of Africa in the 15th century.</p>
  <p><strong>Major trade cities:</strong>

  <h3>Circle X: East Asian Circle</h3>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong>
    From the 600s, Korea, Japan and China traded with each other.  The Tang dynasty rulers of China
    invaded the Silla kingdom in Korea and made it into a vassal state of the Chinese empire.  The Silla
    and Goryeo (918-1392) kingdoms in Korea had a tributary relationship with China.  This meant that
    they gave tribute to the emperor and received gifts from him.  They could also trade with China.
    Chinese culture deeply influenced both Korea and Japan.  During the Heian dynasty (794-1185),
    Japanese leaders read Chinese literature and copied Chinese styles. During the Medieval period in
    Japan (1185-1573) trade between China and Japan grew enormously.</p>
